desync
======

This project re-implements many features of upstream [casync](https://github.com/systemd/casync) in [Go](https://golang.org/). It seeks to maintain compatibility with casync's data structures, protocols and types, such as chunk stores (castr), index files (caibx/caidx) and archives (catar) in order to function as a drop-in replacement in many use cases. It also tries to maintain support for platforms other than Linux and simplify build/installation. It consists of a [library](https://godoc.org/github.com/folbricht/desync) that implements the features, available for integration into any 3rd-party product as well as a command-line tool.

For support and discussion, see [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/desync-casync-client/Lobby.png)](https://gitter.im/desync-casync-client/Lobby). Feature requests should be discussed there before filing, unless you're interested in doing the work to implement them yourself.

## Goals And Non-Goals

Among the distinguishing factors:
- Supported on MacOS, though there could be incompatibilities when exchanging catar-files between Linux and Mac for example since devices and filemodes differ slightly. \*BSD should work as well but hasn't been tested. Windows supports a limited subset of commands.
- Where the upstream command has chosen to optimize for storage efficiency (f/e, being able to use local files as "seeds", building temporary indexes into them), this command chooses to optimize for runtime performance (maintaining a local explicit chunk store, avoiding the need to reindex) at cost to storage efficiency.
- Where the upstream command has chosen to take full advantage of Linux platform features, this client chooses to implement a minimum featureset and, while high-value platform-specific features (such as support for btrfs reflinks into a decompressed local chunk cache) might be added in the future, the ability to build without them on other platforms will be maintained.
- SHA512/256 is currently the only supported hash function.
- Only chunk store using zstd compression are supported at this point.
- Supports local stores as well as remote stores (as client) over SSH, SFTP and HTTP
- Built-in HTTP(S) chunk server that can proxy multiple local or remote stores and also supports caching.
- Drop-in replacement for casync on SSH servers when serving chunks read-only
- Support for catar files exists, but ignores XAttr, SELinux, ACLs and FCAPs that may be present in existing catar files and those won't be present when creating a new catar with the `tar` command
- Supports chunking with the same algorithm used by casync (see `make` command) but executed in parallel. Results are identical to what casync produces, same chunks and index files, but with significantly better performance. For example, up to 10x faster than casync if the chunks are already present in the store. If the chunks are new, it heavily depends on I/O, but it's still likely several times faster than casync.
- While casync supports very small min chunk sizes, optimizations in desync require min chunk sizes larger than the window size of the rolling hash used (currently 48 bytes). The tool's default chunk sizes match the defaults used in casync, min 16k, avg 64k, max 256k.
- Allows FUSE mounting of blob indexes
- S3 protocol support to access chunk stores for read operations and some some commands that write chunks

## Parallel chunking
One of the significant differences to casync is that desync attempts to make chunking faster by utilizing more CPU resources, chunking data in parallel. Depending on the chosen degree of concurrency, the file is split into N equal parts and each part is chunked independently. While the chunking of each part is ongoing, part1 is trying to align with part2, and part3 is trying to align with part4 and so on. Alignment is achieved once a common split point is found in the overlapping area. If a common split point is found, the process chunking the previous part stops, eg. part1 chunker stops, part2 chunker keeps going until it aligns with part3 and so on until all split points have been found. Once all split points have been determined, the file is opened again (N times) to read, compress and store the chunks. While in most cases this process achieves significantly reduced chunking times at the cost of CPU, there are edge cases where chunking is only about as fast as upstream casync (with more CPU usage). This is the case if no split points can be found in the data between min and max chunk size as is the case if most or all of the file consists of 0-bytes. In this situation, the concurrent chunking processes for each part will not align with each other and a lot of effort is wasted. The table below shows how the type of data that is being chunked can influence runtime of each operation. `make` refers to the process of chunking, while `extract` refers to re-assembly of blobs from chunks.

Command | Mostly/All 0-bytes  | Typical data
------------ | ------------- | ------------
make | Slow (worst-case) - Likely comparable to casync | Fast - Parallel chunking
extract | Extremely fast - Effectively the speed of a truncate() syscall | Fast - Done in parallel, usually limited by I/O

## Tool

The tool is provided for convenience. It uses the desync library and makes most features of it available in a consistent fashion. It does not match upsteam casync's syntax exactly, but tries to be similar at least.

### Installation

If GOPATH is set correctly, building the tool and installing it into `$GOPATH/bin` can be done with:
```
go get -u github.com/folbricht/desync/cmd/desync
```

### Subcommands
- `extract`      - build a blob from an index file
- `verify`       - verify the integrity of a local store
- `list-chunks`  - list all chunk IDs contained in an index file
- `cache`        - populate a cache from index files without extracting a blob or archive
- `chop`         - split a blob according to an existing caibx and store the chunks in a local store
- `pull`         - serve chunks using the casync protocol over stdin/stdout. Set `CASYNC_REMOTE_PATH=desync` on the client to use it.
- `tar`          - pack a catar file, optionally chunk the catar and create an index file. Not available on Windows.
- `untar`        - unpack a catar file or an index referencing a catar. Not available on Windows.
- `prune`        - remove unreferenced chunks from a local or S3 store. Use with caution, can lead to data loss.
- `chunk-server` - start a chunk server that serves chunks via HTTP(S)
- `make`         - split a blob into chunks and create an index file
- `mount-index`  - FUSE mount a blob index. Will make the blob available as single file inside the mountpoint.
- `info`         - Show information about an index file, such as number of chunks and optionally chunks from an index that a re present in a store

### Options (not all apply to all commands)
- `-s <store>` Location of the chunk store, can be local directory or a URL like ssh://hostname/path/to/store. Multiple stores can be specified, they'll be queried for chunks in the same order. The `chop`, `make`, `tar` and `prune` commands support updating chunk stores in S3, while `verify` only operates on a local store.
- `-c <store>` Location of a chunk store to be used as cache. Needs to be writable.
- `-n <int>` Number of concurrent download jobs and ssh sessions to the chunk store.
- `-r` Repair a local cache by removing invalid chunks. Only valid for the `verify` command.
- `-y` Answer with `yes` when asked for confirmation. Only supported by the `prune` command.
- `-l` Listening address for the HTTP chunk server. Can be used multiple times to run on more than one interface or more than one port. Only supported by the `chunk-server` command.
- `-m` Specify the min/avg/max chunk sizes in kb. Only applicable to the `make` command. Defaults to 16:64:256 and for best results the min should be avg/4 and the max should be 4*avg.
- `-i` When packing/unpacking an archive, don't create/read an archive file but instead store/read the chunks and use an index file (caidx) for the archive. Only applicable to `tar` and `untar` commands.
- `-t` Trust all certificates presented by HTTPS stores. Allows the use of self-signed certs when using a HTTPS chunk server.
- `-key` Key file in PEM format used for HTTPS `chunk-server` command. Also requires a certificate with `-cert`
- `-cert` Certificate file in PEM format used for HTTPS `chunk-server` command. Also requires `-key`.
- `-k` Keep partially assembled files in place when `extract` fails or is interrupted. The command can then be restarted and it'll not have to retrieve completed parts again.

### Environment variables
- `CASYNC_SSH_PATH` overrides the default "ssh" with a command to run when connecting to a remote SSH or SFTP chunk store
- `CASYNC_REMOTE_PATH` defines the command to run on the chunk store when using SSH, default "casync"
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY` and `S3_SECRET_KEY` can be used to define S3 store credentials if only one store is used. Caution, these values take precedence over any S3 credentials set in the config file.

### Caching
The `-c <store>` option can be used to either specify an existing store to act as cache or to populate a new store. Whenever a chunk is requested, it is first looked up in the cache before routing the request to the next (possibly remote) store. Any chunks downloaded from the main stores are added to the cache. In addition, when a chunk is read from the cache and it is a local store, mtime of the chunk is updated to allow for basic garbage collection based on file age. The cache store is expected to be writable. If the cache contains an invalid chunk (checksum does not match the chunk ID), the operation will fail. Invalid chunks are not skipped or removed from the cache automatically. `verfiy -r` can be used to
evict bad chunks from a local store or cache.

### Multiple chunk stores
One of the main features of desync is the ability to combine/chain multiple chunk stores of different types and also combine it with a cache store. For example, for a command that reads chunks when assembling a blob, stores can be chained in the command line like so: `-s <store1> -s <store2> -s <store3>`. A chunk will first be requested from `store1`, and if not found there, the request will be routed to `<store2>` and so on. Typically, the fastest chunk store should be listed first to improve performance. It is also possible to combine multiple chunk stores with a cache. In most cases the cache would be a local store, but that is not a requirement. When combining stores and a cache like so: `-s <store1> -s <store2> -c <cache>`, a chunk request will first be routed to the cache store, then to store1 followed by store2. Any chunks that is not yet in the cache will be stored there upon first request.

Not all types of stores support all operations. The table below lists the supported operations on all store types.

| Operation | Local store | S3 store | HTTP store | SFTP | SSH (casync protocol)
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Read chunks | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Write chunks | yes | yes | yes | yes | no |
| Use as cache | yes | yes | yes |yes | no |
| Prune | yes | yes | no | yes | no |
| Verify | yes | yes | no | no | no |

### S3 chunk stores
desync supports reading from and writing to chunk stores that offer an S3 API, for example hosted in AWS or running on a local server. When using such a store, credentials are passed into the tool either via environment variables `S3_ACCESS_KEY` and `S3_SECRET_KEY` or, if multiples are required, in the config file. Care is required when building those URLs. Below a few examples:

#### AWS
This store is hosted in `eu-west-3` in AWS. `s3` signals that the S3 protocol is to be used, `https` should be specified for SSL connections. The first path element of the URL contains the bucket, `desync.bucket` in this example. Note, when using AWS, no port should be given in the URL!
```
s3+https://s3-eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/desync.bucket
```
It's possible to use prefixes (or "directories") to object names like so
```
s3+https://s3-eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/desync.bucket/prefix
```

#### Other service with S3 API
This is a store running on the local machine on port 9000 without SSL.
```
s3+http://127.0.0.1:9000/store
```

#### Previous S3 storage layout
Before April 2018, chunks in S3 stores were kept in a flat layout, with the name being the checksum of the chunk. Since then, the layout was modified to match that of local stores: `<4-checksum-chars>/<checksum>.cacnk` This change allows the use of other tools to convert or copy stores between local and S3 stores. To convert an existing s3 store from the old format, a command `upgrade-s3` is available in the tool.

### Configuration

For most use cases, it is sufficient to use the tool's default configuration not requiring a config file. Having a config file `$HOME/.config/desync/config.json` allows for further customization of timeouts, error retry behaviour or credentials that can't be set via command-line options or environment variables. To view the current configuration, use `desync config`. If no config file is present, this will show the defaults. To create a config file allowing custom values, use `desync config -w` which will write the current configuration to the file, then edit the file.

Available configuration values:
- `http-timeout` - HTTP request timeout used in HTTP stores (not S3) in nanoseconds
- `http-error-retry` - Number of times to retry failed chunk requests from HTTP stores
- `s3-credentials` - Defines credentials for use with S3 stores. Especially useful if more than one S3 store is used. The key in the config needs to be the URL scheme and host used for the store, excluding the path, but including the port number if used in the store URL.

**Example config**

```json
{
  "http-timeout": 60000000000,
  "http-error-retry": 0,
  "s3-credentials": {
    "http://localhost": {
      "access-key": "MYACCESSKEY",
      "secret-key": "MYSECRETKEY"
    },
    "https://127.0.0.1:9000": {
      "access-key": "OTHERACCESSKEY",
      "secret-key": "OTHERSECRETKEY"
    }
  }
}
```

### Examples:

Re-assemble somefile.tar using a remote chunk store and a blob index file.
```
desync extract -s ssh://192.168.1.1/path/to/casync.store/ -c /tmp/store somefile.tar.caibx somefile.tar
```

Use multiple stores, specify the local one first to improve performance.
```
desync extract -s /some/local/store -s ssh://192.168.1.1/path/to/casync.store/ somefile.tar.caibx somefile.tar
```

Mix and match remote stores and use a local cache store to improve performance.
```
desync extract \
       -s ssh://192.168.1.1/path/to/casync.store/ \
       -s http://192.168.1.2/casync.store/ \
       -s https://192.168.1.3/ssl.store/ \
       -c /path/to/cache \
       somefile.tar.caibx somefile.tar
```

Extract a file in-place (`-k` option). If this operation fails, the file will remain partially complete and can be restarted without the need to re-download chunks from the remote SFTP store. Use `-k` when a local cache is not available and the extract may be interrupted.
```
desync extract -k -s sftp://192.168.1.1/path/to/store file.caibx file.tar
```

Verify a local cache. Errors will be reported to STDOUT, since `-r` is not given, nothing invalid will be removed.
```
desync verify -s /some/local/store
```

Cache the chunks used in a couple of index files in a local store without actually writing the blob.
```
desync cache -s ssh://192.168.1.1/path/to/casync.store/ -c /local/cache somefile.tar.caibx other.file.caibx
```

List the chunks referenced in a caibx.
```
desync list-chunks somefile.tar.caibx
```

Chop an existing file according to an existing caibx and store the chunks in a local store. This can be used
to populate a local cache from a possibly large blob that already exists on the target system.
```
desync chop -s /some/local/store somefile.tar.caibx somefile.tar
```

Pack a directory tree into a catar file.
```
desync tar archive.catar /some/dir
```

Pack a directory tree into an archive and chunk the archive, producing an index file.
```
desync tar -i -s /some/local/store archive.caidx /some/dir
```

Unpack a catar file.
```
desync untar archive.catar /some/dir
```

Unpack a directory tree using an index file referencing a chunked archive.
```
desync untar -i -s /some/local/store archive.caidx /some/dir
```

Prune a store to only contain chunks that are referenced in the provided index files. Possible data loss.
```
desync prune -s /some/local/store index1.caibx index2.caibx
```

Start a chunk server serving up a local store via port 80.
```
desync chunk-server -s /some/local/store
```

Start a chunk server on port 8080 acting as proxy for other remote HTTP and SSH stores and populate a local cache.
```
desync chunk-server -s http://192.168.1.1/ -s ssh://192.168.1.2/store -c cache -l :8080
```

Copy all chunks referenced in an index file from a remote HTTP store to a remote SFTP store.
```
desync cache -s ssh://192.168.1.2/store -c sftp://192.168.1.3/path/to/store /path/to/index.caibx
```

Start a TLS chunk server on port 443 acting as proxy for a remote chunk store in AWS with local cache. The credentials for AWS are expected to be in the config file under key `https://s3-eu-west-3.amazonaws.com`.
```
desync chunk-server -s s3+https://s3-eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/desync.bucket/prefix -c cache -l 127.0.0.1:https -cert cert.pem -key key.pem
```

Split a blob, store the chunks and create an index file.
```
desync make -s /some/local/store index.caibx /some/blob
```

Split a blob, create an index file and store the chunks in an S3 bucket named `store`.
```
S3_ACCESS_KEY=mykey S3_SECRET_KEY=mysecret desync make -s s3+http://127.0.0.1:9000/store index.caibx /some/blob
```

FUSE mount an index file. This will make the indexed blob available as file underneath the mount point. The filename in the mount matches the name of the index with the extension removed. In this example `/some/mnt/` will contain one file `index`.
```
desync mount-index -s /some/local/store index.caibx /some/mnt
```

Show information about an index file to see how many of its chunks are present in a local store or an S3 store. The local store is queried first, S3 is only queried if the chunk is not present in the local store. The output will be in JSON format (`-j`) for easier processing in scripts.
```
desync info -j -s /tmp/store -s s3+http://127.0.0.1:9000/store /path/to/index
```

## TODOs
- Pre-allocate the output file to avoid fragmentation when using extract command
- Support retrieval of index files from the chunk store
- Allow on-disk chunk cache to optionally be stored uncompressed, such that blocks can be directly reflinked (rather than copied) into files, when on a platform and filesystem where reflink support is available.
